# DisInfected

My first practical application of JS, a small game created in 2017 in HTML Canvas. Try it [here](https://antonistorb.github.io/DisInfected/)!

Thanks to Chris DeLeon for his Game Programming tutorial courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopherleedeleon/), which served as the basis for this project!
